//! THis is based on Keplers law
/*Keplerâ€™s Law states that the planets move around the sun in elliptical orbits with the sun at one focus. Kepler's 3rd law is The Law of Periods, according to which:

The square of the time period of the planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semimajor axis of its orbit.*/
